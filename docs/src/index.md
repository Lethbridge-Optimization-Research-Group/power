# Multiperiod Optimal Power Flow (MPOPF)

Welcome to the documentation for the MPOPF project. This Julia package provides tools for analyzing and optimizing power flow in electrical networks over multiple time periods.

!!! note

    If you are unsure about power flow concepts, please read through the [background page](@ref Background-Information-for-OPF-(Optimal-Power-Flow)).
    It will go over the background on this project such AC and DC Power Flow caluclations as well as different linearization formulas used.
    Additionally, Key terms and variabels along with additional resources for further reading will be provided there.

## Features

- Support for AC and DC power flow models
- Multi-period optimization
- Uncertainty modeling
- Linearization techniques
- Local search optimization
- Feasibility checking
