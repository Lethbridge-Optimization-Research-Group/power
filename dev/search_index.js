This change in direction introduces more variables into the equation we use to calculate it, such variablity in theta and voltage magnitude. AC is made up of both active and reactive power. Active power is usable or consumed electrical energy which reactive power is the part that is introduced due to the alternating current. Reactive power is imaginary, also known as wattless power, and is calculated in Volt-Amperes Reactive (VAR).

We are looking into a different linear approximation that may be more accurate given the way AC works, and the losses associated with it. We are also looking into the uncertainty that is introduced between predictions and actual results and attempting to account for and minimize those differences over multiple time periods. Another area of work in this particular project is local search. Which calculates a local minimum and then compares it to a larger area to see if there is yet a better value.
